# Suba
> Moderation bot using ML to detect bad behaviour, particularly insults.

You can simply **extend** it so that it also **detects pornographic images** outside the designated chat rooms -- but Discord already allows this.

# Features
* Low memory overhead (~40MB, including ML algorithms)
* Low CPU usage (less than 1 core)
* Blazingly fast using Rust and gRPC

# [Remini](https://github.com/Gravitalia/Remini)
We're using our own ML alogirhtms contained into one projet called Remini. (not because of Google's Gemini, but because Plato)

You can take a look to our models (in Python) and our deployment code (in Rust).
